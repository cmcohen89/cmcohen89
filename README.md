I'm Christopher, a full-stack software engineer. After 12 years as owner and operator of a private piano lessons business, the COVID-19 pandemic made the job I knew and loved unviable as I was no longer able to give piano lessons in my wonderful clients' homes. I continued giving piano lessons via Zoom for the clients who were interested in the online format, but it quickly became clear that I would need a new career in the long run.

As someone who has always been interested and actively engaged with computers and technology, I decided I'd finally try my hand at software engineering. Harvard's CS50 was a compelling and challenging introduction to the field, and gave me the confidence that programming was the right fit for me. Shortly after working my way to the end of that course, I applied for and was accepted into the renown coding bootcamp App Academy, and I honestly believe it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The skills I learned and tools I acquired during their 6-month course allowed me to create fantastic web applications from scratch, and have set me up to confidently venture forth into the world of software development with my head held high. I greatly look forward to working in this field and tackling any and all challenges that come my way!

As a full-stack software engineer, I am extremely comfortable and capable with languages like JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, and associated frameworks like React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. I am effective at both Agile and Waterfall methodologies, adherent to RESTful web API design, proficient with SCRUM, Kanban, and GitHub, and experienced with several forms of pair programming. </p>
